The "uploads" folder in the project serves as a storage location for the images uploaded by users through the web interface. 
When a user selects and submits an image for classification, the image file is temporarily stored in the "uploads" folder. 
The Flask application then processes and analyzes this image to make predictions using the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
